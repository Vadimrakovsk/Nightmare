All alone, call my phone, make me feel right
Girl, you know when you call, make me feel right
All alone, call my phone, make me feel right
Girl, you know when you call, make me feel right

I gave her everything
She took my heart and left me lonely
I think broken heart's contagious
I won't fix, I'd rather weep
